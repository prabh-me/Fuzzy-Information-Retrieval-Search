Upper airway obstruction in cicatricial pemphigoid is rarely seen by the anaesthetist. A case of severe dyspnoea due to progressive laryngeal obstruction is presented. Tracheal intubation during induction of general anaesthesia for permanent tracheostomy was extremely difficult and was successfully performed by introducing a size 12 French suction catheter through the stenotic laryngeal orifice. Adequate ventilation was achieved by using the oxygen flush valve to deliver oxygen intermittently through the catheter.
