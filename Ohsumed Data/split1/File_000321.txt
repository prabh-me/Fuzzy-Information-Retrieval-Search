Quality control in the blood bank.

In discussing quality assurance in the blood bank, where many of the standard statistical techniques of measuring accuracy simply do not apply, three questions come to mind: How much? How often? Who says? Because of severe changes in the prospective payment plan and a new interest in cost effectiveness, many transfusion services are re-examining blood banking methodologies and their relative usefulness in promoting patient well-being. Many serologists are beginning to say that "less is better." This concern for simplification and reduction of workload is reflected in the quality control.
