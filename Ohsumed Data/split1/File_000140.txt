We studied a rare case of congenital myofibromatosis of the orbit as part of a generalized multicentric disease in a 5-month-old boy. The ultrasonographic and computed tomographic findings were those of a low-reflective, firm, vascularized, lesion with heterogeneous internal structure. The histopathologic findings showed vascular channels with large polygonal cells and transition toward myofibroblasts with interwoven collagen fiber bundles.
