We have described the rare case of a woman with no recognized predisposing factors for hepatocellular carcinoma in whom a second hepatic neoplasm was successfully resected nine years after a presumed "curative" partial hepatectomy. The importance of long-term measurements of available tumor markers as well as aggressive surgical management is emphasized.
