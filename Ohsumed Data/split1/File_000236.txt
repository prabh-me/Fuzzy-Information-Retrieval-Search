Low-dose etretinate in the maintenance of remission of palmoplantar pustular psoriasis.
.P
CLINICAL TRIAL; JOURNAL ARTICLE.
.W
Twenty patients with palmoplantar pustular psoriasis were treated initially for 4 weeks with 70 mg etretinate daily. This led to clinical improvement and a significant fall in pustule count. The patients were then allocated randomly to 30 mg etretinate daily or placebo for a further 12 weeks. There was a rapid deterioration in the clinical condition and a rise in pustule count in the placebo group. The etretinate-treated group still showed clinical improvement and a significantly lower pustule count after 12 weeks. Clinical side-effects were few and adverse effects on liver function and serum lipids were not found.
