Genitourinary filariasis is a well-known entity in most tropical areas. However, filariasis cannot be eliminated from the differential diagnosis of testicular, epididymal, or spermatic cord masses in nontropical climes. We report a case of filariasis of the spermatic cord that manifested as an unexplained scrotal mass in a patient in Rochester, Minnesota.
