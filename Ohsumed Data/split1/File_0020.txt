Computer-directed stereotaxis was used to obtain tissue diagnosis in two cases of cerebral glioma, one low grade, and the other high grade. Both lesions had a similar computed tomographic appearance. Positron emission tomography was performed in each case using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose. A correlation was made in each case between the metabolic activity of the tumor as measured by positron emission tomography, the radiographic appearance, and the tumor histology.
