The in vitro antibacterial activity of DQ-2556, a new semisynthetic cephalosporin, was compared with that of ceftazidime and cefotaxime. The activity of DQ-2556 against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae was roughly comparable to that of cefotaxime. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, DQ-2556 was slightly less active than ceftazidime. DQ-2556 was more active than the reference cephalosporins against staphylococci. Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were also highly susceptible to DQ-2556.
