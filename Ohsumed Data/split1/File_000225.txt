The distribution and number of lymphocytes, monocytes/macrophages, and cells expressing HLA-DR antigen were studied in frozen biopsy sections of nasal mucosa from 40 healthy adults, using monoclonal antibody avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase techniques. The lymphocyte to monocyte/macrophage ratio was estimated to be 10:1; the T cell to B cell ratio was 3:1; and the T helper/inducer cell to T suppressor/cytotoxic cell ratio averaged 2.5:1. Regional differences were observed with a relatively increased number of T suppressor/cytotoxic cells around submucosal glands, and a relatively large number of B cells in lymphocyte aggregates in the lamina propria. The HLA-DR antigen was expressed in epithelial cells, suggesting involvement of surface epithelium of human airway in local immune responses.
