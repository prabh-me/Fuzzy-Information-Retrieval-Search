Motor end-plate distribution in the human interarytenoid muscle.

Histochemical and computer graphic techniques were used to determine the distribution of neuromuscular junctions in the human interarytenoid (IA) muscle. The motor end-plates of four IA specimens obtained from normal postmortem larynges were visualized using an acetylcholinesterase stain. The three-dimensional distribution of motor end-plates was later reconstructed using computer graphics. The motor end-plates in the IA were found to be distributed in an inverted "Y" configuration. A broad band of end-plates was found at the midpoint of the muscle fibers in the superior and middle aspect of the muscle. This band divided obliquely in a lateral direction toward the inferior border of the muscle. This pattern of motor end-plate distribution is possibly consistent with the bilateral innervation of the IA by the recurrent laryngeal nerves.
