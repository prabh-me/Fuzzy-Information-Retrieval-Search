The mortality rate of severe intra-abdominal infections is still very high. The open management of the abdomen is a method of treatment which has gained popularity over the past few years. Its advantages include a better drainage of the peritoneal cavity, a greater protection of the parietes, an improved perfusion of the abdominal viscera and a decrease in postoperative pulmonary complications. It is indicated in patients with severe intra-abdominal sepsis, especially when multiple re-explorations of the abdomen are likely. A variety of techniques, including the use of Marlex mesh have been devised to contend with possible complications: spontaneous fistulas, exogenous bacterial contamination, evisceration and massive fluid losses. The open method of management has not made the treatment of septic abdomen much easier; it requires intensive care support and repeated assessment of the peritoneal cavity. The closure of the abdomen is a problem which must be addressed when the sepsis has subsided. The value of this technique is still difficult to assess in the absence of controlled randomized trials.
